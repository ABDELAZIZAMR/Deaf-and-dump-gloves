# Deaf-and-dump-gloves
Deaf and dumb people use sign language. These are specific, specific movements through the hands known as gestures to represent the language in which they communicate. This paper aims to convert the manual gesture through electronic devices into audible speech to facilitate communication between people with special needs and the general public.In this research a practical system was developed that allows deaf people to use a device to communicate with the general public. Where the device consists of a wireless glove, and this glove consists of flexible sensors and an accelerometer for these sensors to sense the movement of the hand and fingers, and then they are programmed by the microcontroller, which converts these gestures into a voice in the Arabic language, and it is also possible to control the loads of the house through gestures as well, This device provides an effective means of communication for both deaf and dumb people and normal people and reduces the communication gap between them as it has been tested and this design has given good results.
